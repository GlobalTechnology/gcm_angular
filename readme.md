#gma-js


### :bulb: Quick tip 


To keep both repo in separate directories (this and [php wrapper](https://github.com/GlobalTechnology/gma-app-php)), you can create symbolic link

Don't forget to grant file permissions to 'gma-app-php/app' folder afterwards.


```bash

$ sudo ln -s /home/user_name/projects/gma-js/* /home/user_name/projects/gma-app-php/app


```
